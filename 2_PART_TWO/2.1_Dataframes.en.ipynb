    "*Numpy* is a fundamental Python library for scientific computing. Among its features is the creation of multidimensional arrays, which can be treated as vectors, and is very fast when performing mathematical operations on them. Which makes it a necessary tool for projects with high computing and mathematical calculation requirements and that is why it is so popular in the scientific ecosystem.\n",

    "To get started, we'll import the library and create our first Numpy Array, then affect it with some basic math. It is common to rename the `Numpy` library as `np`."
