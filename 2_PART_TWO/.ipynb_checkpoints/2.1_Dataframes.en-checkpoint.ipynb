These extracted data in the form of dictionaries and lists were converted into a DataFrame which allows easy visualization of the information obtained. In addition, data from the bioactive compounds were obtained, DataFrames were combined, columns were renamed and a panda tool was used to add a new column to the constructed DataFrame."
