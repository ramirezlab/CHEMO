The resulting chain can be long or short, it is addressed until it finds one of the three codons that code for **stop** (UAA, UGA or UAG) (fig. 4), when synthesized, the chain is released from the ribosome and it is modified or combined to form a functional protein with a specific structure involved in some essential process for the cell or organism **<sup> 2 </sup>**."
